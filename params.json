You can run the application with\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nblink-diff --output <output>.png <image1>.png <image2>.png\r\n```\r\nUse ```image1``` and ```image2``` as the images you want to compare.\r\nOnly PNGs are supported at this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe command-line tool exposes a couple of flags and parameters for the comparison:\r\n```\r\n--verbose           Turn on verbose mode\r\n--debug             Turn on debug mode - leaving all filters and modifications on the result\r\n--threshold p       Number of pixels/percent 'p' below which differences are ignored\r\n--threshold-type t  'pixel' and 'percent' as type of threshold.

'Passed' : 'Failed');\r\n      console.log('Found ' + result.differences + ' differences.');\r\n   }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the parameters that were available in the command-line tool are also available through the class constructor, however they might use slightly different wording. The class exposes additional parameters that are not available from the command-line:\r\n* ```imageAPath``` Defines the path to the first image that should be compared (required; imageAPath or imageA is required - see example below)\r\n* ```imageA``` Supplies first image that should be compared (required; imageAPath or imageA is required - see example below) - This can be a PNGImage instance or a Buffer instance with PNG data\r\n* ```imageBPath``` Defines the path to the second image that should be compared (required; imageBPath or imageB is required - see example below)\r\n* ```imageB``` Supplies second image that should be compared (required; imageBPath or imageB is required - see example below) - This can be a PNGImage instance or a Buffer instance with PNG data\r\n* ```imageOutputPath``` Defines the path to the output-file. If you leaves this one off, then this feature is turned-off.\r\n* ```imageOutputLimit``` Defines when an image output should be created.

This will make sure that the output image will highlight the differences on the second image.\r\n* ```filter``` Filters that will be applied before the comparison.

'Passed' : 'Failed');\r\n      console.log('Found ' + result.differences + ' differences.');\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Cropping\r\nImages can be cropped before they are compared by using the ```cropImageA``` or ```cropImageB``` parameters. Single values can be left off, and the system will calculate the correct dimensions. However, ```x```/```y``` coordinates have priority over ```width```/```height``` as the position are usually more important than the dimensions - image will also be clipped by the system when needed.\r\n\r\n####Perceptual Comparison\r\nThe perceptual comparison mode considers the perception of colors in the human brain. It transforms all the colors into a human perception color-space, which is quite different to the typical physical bound RGB color-space. There, in the perceptual color-space, the distance between colors is according to the human perception and should therefore closer resemble the differences a human would perceive seeing the images.\r\n\r\n####Logging\r\n\r\nBy default, the logger doesn't log events anywhere, but you can change this behavior by overwriting ```blinkDiff.log```:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar blinkDiff = new BlinkDiff({\r\n    ...\r\n});\r\n\r\nblinkDiff.log = function (text) {\r\n    // Do whatever you want to do\r\n};\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n####Block-Out\r\nSometimes, it is necessary to block-out some specific areas in an image that should be ignored for comparisons. For example, this can be IDs or even time-labels that change with the time. Adding block-outs to images may decrease false positives and therefore stabilizes these comparisons.\r\n\r\nThe color of the block-outs can be selected by the API parameters. However, the block-out areas will not be visible by default - they are hidden even though they are used. To make them visible, turn the debug-mode on.\r\n\r\n##Examples\r\n\r\nThere are some examples in the ```examples``` folder, in which I used screenshots of YDN to check for visual regressions (and made some manual modifications to the dom to make differences appear ;-)).\r\nYou can find examples for:\r\n* Color changes in ```YDN_Color```\r\n* Missing DOM elements in ```YDN_Missing``` (including some anti-aliasing)\r\n* Multiple differences in ```YDN_Multi```\r\n* Disrupted sorting in ```YDN_Sort```\r\n* Swapped items in ```YDN_Swap``` (including block-out areas)\r\n* Text capitalization in ```YDN_Upper```\r\n\r\nAll screenshots were compared to ```YDN.png```, a previously approved screenshot without a regression.\r\nEach of the regressions has the screenshot and the output result, highlighting the differences.\r\n\r\n##API-Documentation\r\n\r\nGenerate the documentation with following command:\r\n```shell\r\nnpm run docs\r\n```\r\nThe documentation will be generated in the ```docs``` folder of the module root.\r\n\r\n##Tests\r\n\r\nRun the tests with the following command:\r\n```shell\r\nnpm run test\r\n```\r\nThe code-coverage will be written to the ```coverage``` folder in the module root.\r\n\r\n##Project Focus\r\nThere are three types of image comparisons:\r\n* Pixel-by-pixel - Used to compare low-frequency images like screenshots from web-sites, making sure that small styling differences trigger\r\n* Perceptual - Used to compare image creation applications, for example rendering engines and photo manipulation applications that are taking the human perception into account, ignoring differences a human probably would not see\r\n* Context - Used to see if parts of images are missing or are severely distorted, but accepts smaller and/or perceptual differences\r\n\r\nBlink-Diff was initially created to compare screenshots. These images are generally low-frequency, meaning larger areas with the same color and less gradients than in photos. The pixel-by-pixel comparison was chosen as it will trigger for differences that a human might not be able to see. We believe that a bug is still a bug even if a human won't see it - a regression might have happened that wasn't intended.\r\nA perceptual comparison would not trigger small differences, possibly missing problems that could get worse down the road.\r\nPixel-by-pixel comparisons have the reputation of triggering too often, adding manual labor, checking images by hand. Blink-Diff was created to keep this in mind and was optimized to reduce false-positives by taking sub-pixeling and anti-aliasing into account. Additional features like thresholds and the pythagorean distance calculation in the four dimensional color-space makes sure that this won't happen too often. Additionally, filters can be applied to the images, for example to compare luminosity of pixels and not the saturation thereof.\r\nBlink-Diff also supports partially the perceptual comparison that can be turned on when supplying ```perceptual=true```. Then, the colors will be compared in accordance with the human perception and not according to the physical world. High-frequency filters, however, are not yet supported.\r\n\r\n##Project Naming\r\nThe name comes from the [Blink comparator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_comparator) that was used in Astronomy to recognize differences in multiple photos, taking a picture of the same area in the sky over consecutive days, months, or years. Most notably, it was used to discover Pluto.\r\n\r\n##Contributions\r\nFeel free to create an issue or create a pull-request if you have an idea on how to improve blink-diff. We are pretty relaxed on the contribution rules; add tests for your pull-requests when possible, but it is also ok if there are none - we'll add them for you. We are trying to improve blink-diff as much as possible, and this can only be done by contributions from the community.\r\n\r\nAlso, even if you simply gave us an idea for a feature and did not actually write the code, we will still add you as the Contributor down below since it probably wouldn't be there without you.
